				<h2>About Me!</h2>
				<p>My name is Baqar Mirza, pronounced Bah-ker. My role in this group is to act as a designer of the app. I will be creating the stylesheet along with my other group mates that are also designers of the group. The social issue of mental health is imprtant to me because many teenagers seem to have hard and difficult times ahead of them. Stress about school, work, or applying to colleges are very stressful and time consuming and wanting to have a break for your mental health is very important to us. As a group and we hope to create a app takling this issue and providing a free and easy to use app that can assess, monitor, and help better the users mental health. </p>
