      <hr>
      <p>Write about yourself and your role in the team and why the social issue topic is important to you. My name is
        Zainab Majidi and I am 17 years old. In this app project, I hope to contribute in several ways including making
        the app pleasing to the audience through colors,designs but also making sure it offers several other beneficial
        programs including the journal and chat room. <br><br>
        Within this project, my role is labeled as a UI designer otherwise knwon as the User Interface Designer which
        deals with the look of the app such as what colors, fonts, icons, will be utilized to attract people to our app.
        Being the UI designer does not mean I'm limited to just dealing with the appearance of the app, however, this is
        the main role I will be taking on. At the end of the making of this app, I hope to gain a lot of skills and be
        able to satisfy the target users.
