			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>Hello, my name is <strong>Jiaxin Lin</strong>, and I am excited to be participating in this competition where it has the possibility of changing someone's life. The team of 5 that I am lucky to be part of is called <i>Sapling</i>, and the social problem we are trying to tackle is youth unemployment. We decided to take on this challenge because many of us have experienced this problem ourselves or have seen our peers face the same challenge.</p>
			<p>Our first steps in addressing this issue included identifying our target audience and exploring possible solutions. We named our app Job Sprout because finding a job is like a growing process. We want everyone to grow together as a community. Many teens are struggling in low-income areas, and we hope that Job Sprout can help bridge the gap between young people looking for work and employers, ultimately helping them succeed in life.</p>
